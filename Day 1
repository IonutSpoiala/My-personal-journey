    Hello there again. The first day of my journey is about to end and i'm glad to say
that i'm not disapointed in my progress so far. 
  You may be wandering what progress could i possibly make in just a day...right? Well, 
i got from just a guy who could write some loops to solve some basic mathematical 
problems in different programing languages like python and ruby... to be able to 
create my first website interface. It's still kind of static but still.... i have
learned a lot since yesterday. 
  I have found this website caled freecodecamp.com and i've been lerning from it like 
  crazy. And it's pretty
interesting also. It covers web developement from the basics (Responsive web design) 
to the more advanced things like javascript, front-end libraries, microtransactions and 
information security. They even offer some "Certifications", uselles but hey, look at
the good part. You get tons of experience by completing these courses and you also 
buid yourself a nice portofolio. 
  I think i'm going to stick with web design for a while.... since it will be kind of 
usefoul later in penetration testing. Or at least i think it will be. Especialy the 
javascript, and the back end libraries. If not, that's ok. I still enjoy web 
development pretty much. Even if i need a small program to do something for me or 
something similar. I can still write it in javascript and run it ofline in a browser
