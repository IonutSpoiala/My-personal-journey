     A new day has passed. and what a day...a quite wounderfoul one. 
Today i continued with the freecodeamp course and i finished all the 
lessons from the first certification. All that i have left to do now 
is to complete the whole 5 projects needed to get the certification.
   Ofcourse, this is just the first course the "Responsive Web Design 
Certification". After that i intend to get into creating more complex
things, like dynamic sites with Javascrip. And hey, there is a course
for that too. What an awesome site, isn't it? 
    The thing that bugs me right now is that... the Responsive Design
 certification has an average time of completion of 300 hours. I have 
 gone trought all of it just 2 days. around 5, maximum 6 days, to
 complete it all, with whole 5 projects created an all. An aproximative
 of 50 - max 60 hours. And i know for a fact that i'm not a genius, so 
 ....have they aproximated wrong? who knows? Maybe i'm a genius....
 and i don't know it yet. Hahahaah....lol.
      Anyways, i looked into peenetration testing a little more and i 
  found some liux distributions created specifically for this purpoise.
  Kali Linux, Parrot Os, BackTrack, BlackBox and a few more. 
       After i looked them up on the internet i think i'l go with Kali.
  It seems to be the most stable one, at least for the majority of users 
  from forums, so i think it's a good choice. As a matter of fact, it
  can even run on my smartphone. So...that's a plus in the future.
  
        So, for now...my goal is to finish the Responsive Web Design
  Certification, and also..to install a Linux distribution so i can start
  learning penetration testing.
