    Merry Christmas people. Tomorow is the first day of Christmas.......and i'almoust
forgot to write this day's entry here. Well doday was my first introductory day in 
penetration testing. And i have to say, it was great. I have not instaled Kali linux 
in my pc, becouse i id't want a dual boot partition at the moment. Instead, i instaled 
a little Linux distro in Android. No not a full distro. A small one with a few commands,
called Termux. The good thing is that even if this distro doesn't officialy suport any 
other repositories....you can still install them manually from git and well....it's 
kind of great. So, for now i have a fully functional Linux distro with Nmap and Metasploit
installed, and working well. 
    I tried to install Kali Nethunter but sadlly i did't succeedee so that's how i actually
got with Termux. My phone it's not suported, since i have an old Note 3, so i had to 
improvise. Anyway...in the next few days i may be able to learn more. 

    Right now i discovered a site Called OverTheWire that trains you in penetration testing
and also another one called BlackBox. In the next few days, i think i'll stick with OverTheWire
and a bit more web design. For now, See you later.
