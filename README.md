  Hello there, today i am starting my personal journey in to the world of coding. 
  I'm curentlly 18 and this week i decided that i'll dedicate my free time for the pursue
of joining and helping te coding comunity. 
  I am looking forward to dwelve into the software developement, web developement and penetration testing since
it was a subject that fascinated me since i was a kid. I would also like to get some 
insights in mobile developement, but it will be a long journey until then.

  If you would like to give me some advice, share something or you have any project on witch 
you may have some need for a creative mind... give me an email and i'll be glad to get in 
touch with you. Experience is something verry valuable that can't be replaced by anything,
so i learned to be in constant pursue or it. 
  Curentlly i have some "experience", in Python, Ruby, CSS, Javascrip, C#, Java and Kotlin,
 but nothing more than just some basics in order to solve some basic math problems. 
 Right now...I'm looking forward to learn more.
